									I am passionate about using technology for the social good--to assist humans with physical disabilities and to develop learning tools used in an educational setting. For the past two summers, I worked in the brain computer interface field at the laboratory of <a href="http://www.neurobio.pitt.edu/faculty/schwartz.htm" target="_blank">Dr. Andrew Schwartz (University of Pittsburgh)</a> developing an algorithm to be used in projects evaluating volitional strength required for 3D movement of a robotic arm under different and random levels of resistance.  These robotic arms are being used in experimental primates and humans with recording and stimulating microarray electrodes implanted in their brains.  

								</p>

								<p>

									For my final project in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/" target="_blank">15-112</a>, a Carnegie Mellon Computer Science course that I took between my sophomore and junior year, I created a web based learning tool which tests users on English grammar.  I  piloted this educational tool at my school which incorporated it in several English classes and Steel City Squash incorporated it in its curriculum and  hope to incorporate it in other educational settings.

								<h4 class="proj_header">Developing Programs for the BURT Robotic arm for use on Primates Prosthetic Limbs</h4>

								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->

								<p>This summer, I am working in the Brain Computer Interface Laboratory of Dr. Andrew Schwartz (University of Pittsburgh) developing an algorithm to be used in projects evaluating volitional strength required for 3D movement of a robotic arm under different and random levels of resistance. Currently, the Schwartz Lab has developed a brain-controlled prosthetic arm which can realistically execute 3-dimensional motion and provide the user with basic sensory feedback.  Neuronal information is decoded by microelectrodes implanted in the brain in the motor and sensory cortex which through complex computational analysis produces motion of a robotic arm. One of the next frontiers for this research is to understand how the brain reacts to uncertainty. For example, the current prototype of the human controlled robotic arm is unable to titrate the force required for different types of actions. In other words, subjects are uncertain as to exactly how much force is necessary to grip an object to not only ensure that it does not fall through their grip but also that it is not crushed due to a too firm grip. Previous research has shown that humans increase accuracy by stiffening their muscles. Therefore, to address uncertainty in prosthetics, the lab strives to develop a model for how and when the brain regulates timing and anatomical location of muscle stiffening.</p>

								<p>My part in this project is to develop programs for the Proficio Robotic Arm created by Barrett Medical for use in primate experimentation. I developed ballistic release software along various 2d paths toward a target and an accompanying python visualization. In less technical terms, a user must first apply force on the robot to overcome some unknown force threshold. After, the robot will cease to apply the opposing force; the subject must quickly stop the robot inside a target zone. I also programmed an accompanying graphics program to orient subjects in space and clearly display the target zone. The ballistic release coupled with targets create an environment where subjects must apply enough force to overcome the threshold but not excessive force so that they can quickly adapt projected movements. I am currently working on integrating the code into Dragonfly, a messaging system which the Schwartz Lab uses for communication between robots and operating machines.</p>

								<h4 class="proj_header">Sentence Generator Webapp</h4>

								<p>I have created a grammar learning tool, which generates a random sentence and asks students questions about the generated sentence. In the tool, student can start different lessons where the student can read a description of a certain part of speech or phrase. Then, the student will proceed to the stage where the software generates a random sentence and asks the student a question pertaining to the current lesson. The tool uses computational linguistics to generate sentences that at least somewhat make sense and are "interesting" in order to keep students engaged. The tool initially read a text to develop a wordnet but was manually refined afterwards for accuracy.</p>

								<p>As a part of Carnegie Mellon's <a class="external-link" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/" target="_blank">15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science</a> class, I used this sentence generator to create a <a href="http://hfriedlander.pythonanywhere.com/sentence/" target="_blank">website</a> that students can use to learn grammar. </p>

								<h4 class="proj_header">CUDA-Accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Simulator</h4>

								<p>I used the CUDA and OpenGL packages to graphically accelerate the Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM) Algorithms. With parallelization and efficient memory usage, considerable optimization and efficiency is possible with LBM simulation. In this simulation, constant 2-dimensional fluid flow through a medium was modeled, and at every lattice node the fluid’s curl, probabilistic velocity vectors, and pressure are calculated and available to be plotted on the screen. Work performed in collaboration with <a class="external-link" href="http://tomscherlis.com/portfolio/" target="_blank">Tom Scherlis</a></p>

								<h4 class="proj_header">Modeling Diffusion Rates of a Gas in an Enclosed Space</h4>

								<p>Identified a relationship between the pressure of a certain gas and diffusive flux in a closed system. With Fick’s First Law of Diffusion as basis for calculations, we used a first order differential equation to discern ideal, theorized relationship between the two parameters. We designed and performed an experiment utilizing diffusion of CO2 into air, confirming the theoretical predictions. Worked in collaboration with Chirag Kulkarni and Haoran Fei.</p>

								<h4 class="proj_header">Shady Side Academy App</h4>

								<p>As a part of the Computer Science Club I founded at my school, I am working to enhance the functionality our school's existing app. We have created an interface which the admistration can use to change the schedule of the app. We are currently working a large overhaul of the current app. Together, we created a new app that allows administrators to edit the schedule in a user-friendly environment. We are adding functionalities for users to share schedules conviently with friends through QR codes, for users to access the daily buletin and lunch menus. We have also created an online interface for the administration to conviently push notifications to the school, and update schedules to quickly react to changes in schedules such as snowdays.</p>

								<p>I have found working on our school's app to be a great way to introduce new students to programming. Club members often find working closely with a client (our school, in this case) to be a very rewarding process. My job is to help manage the app development and coordinate amongst the club's core members, as well as oversee the ramp-up of new members.</p>

								<h4>Computer Architecture: Independent Study with Sol Boucher</h4>

								<p>During an independent study with <a class="external-link" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sboucher/" target="_blank">Sol Boucher</a>, I created a CPU according to the preliminary RISC-V architecture using Logisim, a digital logic circuit simulator. To complete my CPU, I separately wired an ALU, a datapath, a register file, and an instruction decoder. After I finished wiring my CPU, I wrote a RISC-V assembly language implementation of a string reversing program.</p>
